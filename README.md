## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SASS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I learned how to write styles in SASS instead of normal CSS. I get to learn how can we can use Nesting, inheritance, Variables and Import in SASS. Instead of using CSS Variables I use SASS Variables which are more easy to use, in my opinion. After writing all the styles in SASS I compile them in regular CSS by using VS Code Live SASS Compiler Extension.

I also get to learn how we can use svg images instead of normal jpg/png images in our webpages. They are more dynamic and useful. They don't break their resolution when we increase or decrease their size.

### Continued development

I want to learn more about SASS and other CSS properties by doing further Frontend Mentor Challenges. Looking forward for next challenge.

### Useful resources

- [SASS Docs](https://sass-lang.com/) - It contains all the information about SASS and it helps me a lot while learning and writing SASS.
- [SASS Crash Course - Traversy Media](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nu5mdN2JIwM) - Since I learned better from Videos this YouTube Video by Traversy Media helped me a lot while learning how to write SASS.
